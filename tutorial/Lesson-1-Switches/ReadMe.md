# Lesson 1 - install and basic switches
 
 
1.  Copy the tutorial folder containing 4 image files to your www folder (create if you don't have one)

	You should have:	 
	 * config/www/tutorial/base.jpg
	 * config/www/tutorial/dim.png
	 * config/www/tutorial/lite.png
	 * config/www/tutorial/liteoff.png
	 
	 
2.  Paste the text from [tutorial.yaml](https://github.com/bradcrc/color-lite-card/blob/master/tutorial/Lesson-1-Switches/Lesson-Files/tutorial.yaml) to the bottom of your ui-lovelace.yaml file.	 


3.  Edit the text so the sample lights (office_light, Left_lamp, Right_lamp) match real light entities in your HA setup. 




That's it.  

You now have a basic picture elements floor map, and should be able to turn the 3 lights on and off by clicking.

Click and hold a dot for the properties screen.

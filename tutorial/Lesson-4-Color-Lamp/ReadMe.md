For lesson 4,  repeat lesson 3 but for the remaining lamp.  

We'll pick up in GIMP after you've got a new layer already copied and smoothed out.
 
1. Duplicate the layer you just created by right-clicking the layer and picking "duplicate layer" from the popup menu

2. From the color menu, pick "colorize" and set hue to 1,  saturation to 1, and lightness to -0.4

3. Set layer opacity to 60%

4. Hide all other layers and export the image as clampcolor.png
 
5. Export the original non-red layer as clamp.png

6. We're going to put the same reference in the yaml file as the previous 2 lessons, but this time, we're adding the following:

          color_image:            
            /local/tutorial/clampcolor.png
